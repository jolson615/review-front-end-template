# JavaScript Control Flow Project

Let's do this in four major chunks.

1. Set up a grid to put these elements on screen
2. Add an input field and an event listener that logs the contents of the input field every time it changes.
3. Add control flow (including compound logical operators) to manipulate the DOM based on what the user types.
4. Personalize this based on what matters to you.
    * Include the giphy api!
    * Create a button that clears the screen.
    * Find a way to prevent players from finding the same thing twice.
    * Have something special happen (e.g. a success message, an ultra-secret gif, or color scheme change) when all the items have been found.
